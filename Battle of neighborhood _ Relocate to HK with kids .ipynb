Some reasons for this are because of the higher salary packages, better career progression as many MNCs\u2019 regional headquarters are situated here. I just relocated to Hong Kong as my husband was posted here. We encountered great difficulty in finding a full-day childcare for our 2 year old daughter. The public schools are mainly conducted in Cantonese and given that we do not speak this language, we are limited to private international schools. For her age, the pre-nursery classes are usually conducted only for half-day and many families have a domestic helper to help out with the child during the day while they are at home. We did not want to engage in a domestic helper and I would not wish either to be a full-time housewife so we really needed a school that can take her in. Eventually we found something and all works out fine."
